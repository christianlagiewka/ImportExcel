<p>After encountering an issue that I could not Google a solution (look <a href="https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel/issues/790#issuecomment-591705361">here</a>), a request for help was answered by the author who indicated that the solution was non-standard.</p>
<p>There was no documentation for the solution, or other Gotchas, where the solution or formula may differ between manually entering it into Excel vs generating it programatically.<br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1. Formulas with Table references</strong></span><br />In Excel, a VLOOKUP with a reference with a table would be formatted as:&lt;/P&gt;<br /> <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>=VLOOKUP(REFERENCECELL, TableReference, ColumntoDisplay, {True for near match or False for exact match})</em><br /> <br /> <em><strong>Example:</strong></em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>=VLOOKUP($A2,Table_of_Data,2,FALSE)</em><br /> <br />When creating a reference for this same formula in a string, the table reference must end with square brackets: <strong>[]</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Example:</strong></em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>$ReferenceCell = "=VLOOKUP(`$A2,Table_of_Data[],2,FALSE)"</em><br /> </p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Referencing columns in a table</strong></span><br />In Excel, you can reference a column's row in a table in multiple ways.</p>
<p>For example, to get the value of a column in the same row:</p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; =[COLUMN NAME]</em><br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; =[@COLUMN NAME]</em></p>
<p><br />If you reference the cell as part of a string, using the second example, <strong>[@COLUMN NAME]</strong>, produces an <strong>#REF!</strong> error despite it working if you manually enter it within Excel.<br /> <br />Reference the column name using the first example as part of the variable/string:<br /> <br /><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ReferenceCell = "=[COLUMN NAME]"</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; $ReferenceCell = "=[COLUMN FIRST NAME]&amp;"" ""&amp;[COLUMN LAST NAME]"</em><br /><br /></p>
